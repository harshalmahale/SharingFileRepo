Recursive queries are SQL queries that can call themselves.

Recursion has two fundamental cases: the base case and the recursive case.
The base case returns a value without making any recursive calls.
while the recursive case makes one or more recursive calls.

A CTE is a temporary named result set that you can reference within a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement.

CTEs can break down long queries into smaller, more manageable pieces of logic and make them more readable.

A recursive Common Table Expression (CTE) in SQL Server allows you to perform recursive queries on hierarchical or graph-based data structures, such as organizational charts, family trees, transportation networks, etc.

Syntax:

WITH [RECURSIVE]  CTE_name AS
(
	SELECT query (Non Recursive query or the Base query)
	UNION [ALL]
	SELECT query (Recursive query using CTE_name [with a termination condition])

)

Select  * From  CTE_name;

Ex:

Display no. from 1 to 10 without using any in built functions

with recursive numbers as 
(select 1 as n
 union 
 select n + 1
 from numbers where n < 10
 )
Select * from numbers;
